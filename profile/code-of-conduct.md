## Scope

We expect all members of the r3shape community to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all r3shape community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to r3shape affairs.

This policy covers the usage of r3shape public infrastructure, including the r3shape.io HTTP gateways, as well as other r3shape websites, r3shape related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of the r3shape community. It also
applies to behavior in the context of the r3shape open-source project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, social media, and mailing lists.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of r3shape services.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the [r3shape staff](#contact-info).

## Friendly Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please [contact us](#contact-info) to send us an abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

## Copyright Violations

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. If you believe any content or other materials available through public r3shape infrastructure violates a copyright held by you and you would like to submit a notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other similar international law, you can submit a notice to the [abuse team](#contact-info) for service.

(We will add a physical mailing address here when we acquire one).

Please make sure your notice meets the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requirements.

## Consequences

All content published to public r3shape infrastructure is hosted at the sole discretion of the r3shape staff.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the r3shape staff may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the r3shape staff. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

## Contact Info

Please contact d34d0s.dev@gmail.com if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.

We will keep all matters confidential and they will only be shared within the team, with the exception of legal counsel when deemed necessary, or unless given explicit permission by the reporter.

When contacting an individual directly, they will ask for explicit permission to share the details with the rest of the team. When not granted, they will keep details of the matters as confidential as possible (particularly private or identity information) but they may still share broad strokes as necessary to resolve the issue.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
